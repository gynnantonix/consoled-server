This is the directory which will hold documentation generated from the ConsoleClient library.

The generators used are Doxygen (with dot) and Doxygen-filter.
Once both of these packages are installed on your system, saying:
'doxygen Doxyfile' will create documentation for the libraries in ../lib

Please make sure that you've defined the path to your 'dot' executable in the Doxygen configuration file (Doxyfile) before running Doxygen.
